# Documentation for Task1 Project

## 1. Project Design:
- We opted for a simple yet attractive design using the "templatemo-softy-pinko" template to add an elegant and modern touch to the website.

## 2. Technologies Used:
- We utilized HTML language to build the structure of the pages and elements.
- For styling and decorating the website, we employed CSS including Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
- JavaScript and jQuery were used for interacting with elements on the page and adding some advanced functionalities.

## 3. Challenges Faced:
- We encountered challenges in cross-browser compatibility, especially regarding advanced CSS properties.
- There were challenges in website responsiveness and loading speed, so we optimized images and used high-performance loading techniques to enhance the site's performance.
